            <h1>how to create a presentation in shadowpoint</h1>
            <p>- created by shadowdev -</p>
            <strong><p>if you want to find something specific use control + f</p></strong>
            <p>cof stands for config btw</p>
            <br>
            <h1>how to create a presentation directory</h1>
            <p>create a folder named after the presentation</p>
            <br>
            <h1>how to create a slide</h1>
            <p>to create a slide you will have to make a folder named the slide number</p>
            <p>for example the first slide is gonna be named 1 and the second one is gonna be 2</p>
            <img src="/img/exampleslides.png">
            <br>
            <h1>how to change the title and the background and etc</h1>
            <p>create a file named config.cof in your slide folder</p>
            <strong><p>to change a background add a picture to the folder for example bg.png</p></strong>
            <p>and write to the second line \bg.png</p>
            <br>
            <p>if you want to change the <strong>title of the presentation window</strong></p>
            <p>then youl have to open the config.cof and write the window title that you want to use on the first line</p>
            <br>
            <p>if you also want to maybe disable the form icon</p>
            <p>then just go to the third line of config.cof and write true there to disable it</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>thats all for config.cof</p>
            <br>
            <h1>how to add text and pictures to slides</h1>
            <br>
            <p>first youre gonna need to create a file named slide.cof</p>
            <p>and on the first line youre gonna need to put there how many objects</p>
            <p>(an object is a picture or a text) are gonna be on the slide</p>
            <p>and then for the lines after it youl have to reference the objects</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>to reference an object youre gonna have to just write the cof file name like text1.cof to the slide.cof</p>
            <br>
            <p>examples of objects:</p>
            <img src="/img/image1.cof.png">
            <img src="/img/text1.cof.png">
            <p>and if youre done just put there an end folder which is gonna be the last slide</p>
            <p>and after that it just returns to the load to presentation ui</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>so thats it now you know basically how to use shadowpoint have fun using it</p>
